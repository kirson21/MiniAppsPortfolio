The AI engineer's work trajectory details the iterative development of a React portfolio application, primarily focusing on integrating the Maxton Admin Panel mini-app and subsequently resolving numerous UI/UX and responsiveness bugs across all integrated mini-apps (DineHub, Carento, Maxton) and the main landing page.

The process began with a clear request to build Maxton following a modern design based on a GitHub repository and a screenshot. The AI engineer successfully implemented the initial Maxton component, including a dark sidebar, analytics, charts, and data tables, adhering to a professional, emoji-free aesthetic. This involved creating  and  and integrating it into the main .

Significant effort was then dedicated to debugging and refining the application based on continuous user feedback. This included fixing supervisor startup issues, resolving ESLint warnings, handling port conflicts, and addressing critical mobile responsiveness problems in Maxton (card visibility, sidebar width, title size), DineHub (bottom spacing, mobile menu coverage), and Carento (icon alignment). A key technical challenge involved implementing a robust, non-regressive mobile-fullscreen modal system using React hooks to avoid impacting the desktop experience. The engineer also ensured proper Russian translations and consistent styling. The iterative nature of bug fixing, utilizing screenshots and a frontend testing agent, highlights a thorough, feedback-driven development cycle.

4.  **Mini-Apps Integration:** Integrate new projects (frontend-only, mock data); delete old ones.
5.  **Internationalization:** Full Russian translation for all content.

**Specific Feedback & Refinements:**

*   **Maxton:** Admin panel based on  and a provided screenshot. Must be professional, modern, clean, user-friendly, mobile-friendly, with mock data and no cheap emojis.
*   **Bug Reports:**
    *   DineHub: cheap emojis to be replaced with professional SVG icons, bottom spacing for mobile reviews, Add + button size.
    *   Carento: Real brand logos, animation overflow.
    *   General: Russian mobile text overflow with '|' separator, title/subtitle mix-up in Russian, main title size, modal fullscreen on mobile without black backgrounds (no desktop regression), modal top visibility in apps.
    *   Maxton: Mobile card titles invisible, cards too wide, sidebar too wide, main title too large, add more clickable features (e.g., profile settings).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on addressing a series of critical UI/UX bugs reported by the user across the DineHub, Carento, and Maxton mini-apps, as well as the main portfolio landing page. The goal was to refine the application's mobile responsiveness and visual consistency.

The following issues were identified and addressed:
1.  **Modal Top Visibility:** Adjusted modal content height and positioning in  to ensure the top portion of the mini-apps is fully visible on mobile screens.
2.  **Carento Icon Alignment:** Improved CSS in  to ensure icons in the bottom navigation are properly centered above their text labels.
3.  **Maxton Card Visibility & Width:** Modified styles in  to ensure titles within Maxton cards are visible (by enforcing white backgrounds and dark text) and adjusted card padding and width for better readability on mobile, implementing a two-column layout.
4.  **Main Title Text Size (Russian/Mobile):** Applied responsive CSS classes in  and  to dynamically adjust the main portfolio title and subtitle font sizes on mobile devices, preventing truncation, especially for Russian text.

The engineer implemented a responsive modal system using React hooks to differentiate between mobile and desktop views, ensuring that fullscreen modals apply only to mobile without regressing the desktop experience. Additionally,  was updated to provide increased bottom spacing, preventing content from being obscured by the bottom navigation bar on mobile.

These fixes involved extensive debugging, especially for CSS adjustments and React state management, with multiple iterations to resolve compilation and linting errors. The application is now in a state where these specific bugs have been addressed, and initial tests indicate their resolution.
